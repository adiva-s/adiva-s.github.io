        So like I don't know why I'm doing this, but then again I never know what I'm doing half of the time. I'm kinda impulsive like that. Anyways, 
        I thought it would be a neat idea to type up my life story on the internet. Instead, I'll make it like a journal, because I don't do diaries. 
        <strike>That's too girly.</strike> That sounds rude. Okay, no well I just don't vibe with it. Right, plus this could be therapeutic, maybe, who
        knows. Right, well the thing is, I actually have a <strike>good</strike> selective memory. I can remember stuff from two years ago but I cannot
        tell you what I had for breakfast this morning, which was literally ten minutes ago. I want to say I had cereal, but I know for a fact, that I 
        finished all the cereal two weeks ago, and I'm too lazy to buy another box. So yeah. <br><br> Anyways! This is going to be updated randomly. 
        Mainly because it's fun that way, plus, I don't remember a lot of stuff. But then again, I might remember something. Who fucking knows?
        I should, but I don't. Anyways, enjoy my hugely publicized journal, that I for some reason decided to share with everyone like the fucking 
        idiot I am.

            <p>Today’s Friday, the first friday of the semester, my college semester. This week, it’s been okay I guess. 
                But today, I need to go in person for chemistry lab. I have all my stuff - my printed lab, pencil and all. I should be good.
                Why do I have anxiety? I don’t want this. Grr. Whatever. Okay train time. Sixteen stops later, I’m finally at school.
                <br><br>Let’s find out where the room is. Wait, there’s a security guard here. Let me just ask her. Smart thinking over hardworking. 
                Big brain energy. She leads me to the room and I thank her. And there’s people inside already.<br><br>I sit in the second to last row and look around to see if there are any cute guys. 
                Yes I am like this. I’m not denying it. There’s like two cute guys, I admit. Anyways, there’s an asian girl besides me. 
                I think I’d like to be friends with her. Except social anxiety! Okay, I’ll try later on. But I’m not promising myself anything.<br><br>
                Dr. Sun is really nice and pretty too. But she’s really nice. I like her vibes, and she’s just really nice. And she knows what she’s talking about too. 
                Today we’re just going over lab rules and all. It’s an easy day today. That’s nice. 
                Ooo, time to go to lab. And we’re going upstairs. Don’t you just love exercising at 9 am in the morning? What better way to start the day?

        <p>
            Okay look, first thing your should know about me is to no trust me. Do not, and I seriously
            mean this, deadass I mean this - do not ever, E - V - E - R, take me as your role model.
            I am a terrible one. I'm being so serious when I say this. 
            <br><br>
            Okay look, so all my classes are online, right? Thank God for that too by the way. I would
            never want to take Calculus 2 in person. I think I would actually die from all the math.
            Right well, anyways, back to what I was saying. 
            <br><br>
            Do not take me as your role model. Why am I saying this> Because I love to go on my phone.
            And naturally I'm going to use my phone's alarm to wake me up for class, right?
            Well guess what bitches? 
            It's not even the third day of classes, and I'm going on my phone unil 7 am, and my class is
            at 9 am. 
            <br><br>
            Fuck myself.

        <p>
            Ok, so in terms of my classes. Well, let's just say it's a good thing my classes are online.
            Because I don't know what the fuck I am doing. I'm being so serious right now. I have no idea
            what the fuck is going on in any of my classes. I pretty much zone out of all my classes right
            after I click on the Zoom link. I make sure my mic and camera are off. I either go to sleep. 
            Or I go on my phone, or I go on my laptop, doing who knows what.
            <br><br>
            Dear God, why the fuck do we have be in groups already? Shit, I should not curse. 
            <br><br>
            Hey God, sorry about that. But it's just the first week of classes, why are we going into groups already?
            Like what are we supposed to talk about?
            <br><br>
            This semester is going to be absolutely wonderful.

            It was 8 am or maybe later. Does the time really matter? Moving on, the uditorium wasn’t too bad. 
            It wasn’t cold or too warm. But the desks were small, my notebook definitely didn’t fit on the desk. 
            Professor - whatever his name is - is talking and drawing diagrams. And I suppose I should pay attention, 
            I muse to myself. 
            <br><br>But it’s just the beginning of the semester, I still have some time don’t I. And it doesn’t seem 
            too bad, as long as I study afterward, I rationalize. I have been on my phone way too much, well Instagram. 
            And no one is replying back. I guess I’ll take a break. I look around the auditorium and it’s packed. 
            <br><br>How many students really plan on doing electrical engineering or computer engineering? Every morning since 
            the first class, I familiarized myself with who was in front of me on the left side and the center. I recognized 
            everyone - well their faces, despite the masks. And today was different, seeing as someone with a cap was sitting 
            in the center, one of the front rows. I wondered how they looked. Well, I wouldn’t be able to see how they looked now. 
            And they were actively taking notes, so they were studious for sure, unlike me.<br><br>It was time to take notes. 
        </p>

        <p>
            It’s the next day. And it’s time for physics. Physics - the bane of my existence. Physics one was a nightmare. 
            Physics two is plain torture. It’s only a few weeks in, and I’m terribly lost. I think maybe I’m just not cut out 
            to be an engineer.  But then again, it’s not like I’m trying. But the thing is, I’ve tried when I’m with myself 
            to learn and understand. And it just doesn’t make any sense. Even while doing the homework as well. 
            <br><br>Let’s not even talk about the quizzes. Those were a nightmare, absolute nightmares. I see I’m a liar; and 
            we are indeed talking about the quizzes. I didn’t think it was possible, but I managed to make it possible. 
            I got a 2/10 on my first quiz. Absolutely wonderful. <br><br>My second quiz I managed to outdo myself, and get 
            1.5/10. It says on the syllabus that only the two lowest quizzes get dropped. And right now, I’m just thinking how 
            I can do any worse. But I know myself, and I’ll most likely get a 0 on my next quiz. I’m definitely not fit to be 
            an engineer. Maybe I should give up on my future already. <br><br>Ok, no. That’s terrible thinking. I can’t just 
            give up already. It’s still September. First month in, and I’m thinking of giving up. Shame on me. <br><br>Ok, let’s 
            try to focus on physics while crying on the inside. I turn off my phone and get ready to write down whatever 
            Professor - whatever his name is number two - drew, when I catch sight of a cap. <br><br>
            I turn my head slightly. <br><br> And no fucking way. <br><br> I think it’s cap boy from circuit class. But I am not sure. <br><br>
            I’m a fucking idiot for sure. But this requires an investigation. Forget physics; it’s not as important as this. <br><br>
            Maybe I’ll regret saying that. I don’t know. 
        </p>
        <br>______<br><br><br>
        <div id="f2021e3">entry # 3</div>
        <p>
            Okay, so it’s now a few days later. So I noticed him - I sound like such a fucking creep - before and after class for a few days. 
            And I’m pretty sure he’s in both of my classes.<br><br>But a good investigation needs evidence. So I’ll prove this with evidence. 
            I noticed one day he carried a tote bag. And the next day, he brought a backpack. I waited a few more days, and it’s the same backpack.
            I’m not sure how it makes sense, but he’s definitely the same boy, in both my physics class and circuits class. And I don’t know why, 
            but now I just want to be friends with him.<br><br>It’s like how I wanted to be friends with A in junior year of highschool. I really wanted 
            to be friends with her. And despite social anxiety, I did it and started talking to her. And now we’re really good friends.<br><br>The problem 
            is my social anxiety. It’s a fucking mess, and loves to mess with me. I keep on telling myself I’ll ask after class if he’s also taking physics.
            But that doesn’t go well. I’m like okay this day for sure. And it doesn’t happen. And the next time, too. I stay a little bit longer to ask. 
            <br><br>But I’m a coward, but we all know that. 
        </p>

        <div id="f2021e4">entry # 4</div>
        <p>
            Okay. It’s wednesday, October 6. I’m in physics. And my stomach is swarming with butterflies, moths, everything. I’m feeling very anxious. 
            And I still want to be friends with him. But I’m a mess, not the pretty kind, which would make it more tolerable. But then again, the universe 
            has never been in my favor. <br><br>Ok, I’ll ask before class. I tell this to myself and repeat it over and over again. And he sits down in the 
            seat beside me, though there is space. But same point. I’m pushing myself to ask. And then Professor - well I'm not going to say the whole 
            thing again, frankly it takes too much effort to write and I am most definitely lazy - starts speaking. <br><br> To tell you the truth, I’m not 
            surprised. I’m a pity case. <br><br> -- <br><br> Finally it’s break time. Break time is like my savior. I cannot go too long thinking of physics 
            without going insane.<br><br>I really want to ask and ask. But social anxiety has me in a steel grip. Okay, you know what. Fuck it. Screw it. I’m
            also really glad we have to wear masks, so he can’t see me turn red. And it’s not pretty. <br><br>  I’m doing it. I’m doing it. I turn to my side, 
            lean a bit forward and tap my knuckles on the desk. And he’s turning around. <br><br>Here it goes. “Do you, um, um, um -” <br><br>Gods, I’m such an 
            embarrassment. “- take -” what’s that class called “- uh, uh, uh -” <br><br> My face is burning red. Thank God we wear masks otherwise I would die 
            right there. <br><br>“- circuits -” that’s the class! “- with Professor - -” <br><br> He nods his head. So the investigation proved right as
            embarrassing as it was. <br><br> “I thought you looked familiar.” is the last thing I say before break ends. <br><br>Well, at least I got it over 
            with. I’m still embarrassed. And I’m really glad we wear masks. Ok, back to physics. <br><br> -- <br><br>Class is over finally. Thank God. <br><br>
            We leave the room, and his backpack is unzipped. Is this another conversation starter? Yes it is, and I’m taking it. It’s better than before. I tap 
            him and tell him. And then it’s awkward. Wonderful. <br><br> But then he asks me my name. And I tell him. Then, I ask him his name.<br><br>'O'<br><br>
            It’s a pretty name.<br><br>And we’re headed our different ways now. But that’s it. 
        </p>

        <div id="f2021e5">entry # 5</div>
        <p>
            It is thursday, October 7. And today is our linear algebra exam. And I am screwed. I am going to die. I know absolutely nothing. A meets up with me 
            in the library and teaches me L’Hopital’s Method and something. And I sort of get it. And we’re off to the auditorium where others wait. <br><br>
            Wait a minute - <br><br> Is that O? Looks like him, could be. Let’s find out. A follows me, and I go up to him. <br><br>“O?” <br><br> He says my name.
            And I nod, pleased he remembered my name. <br><br> A insults me, asking if I have friends. Well no duh asshat, what was she then? My pet?<br><br>
            I’m about to say something to him, but A tells me F’s here. She’s here? But I don’t want to leave him alone? Ugh. <br><br>“I’m coming right back.” 
            I promise him as A drags me to the bathroom where F is panicking. I know I should be panicking as I know I’m failing, but I’m calm. Maybe because I 
            know it's too late to do anything.<br><br>We’re back. And we all go inside the auditorium as I introduce F and A to O. And they talk about the exam.
            We put our stuff together and take seats. I look at the exam. <br><br>And I’m fucked up. I know nothing.<br><br> ----- <br><br> That exam was terrible.
            It was beyond words. That terrible. Gods, I don't even want to think about it anymore. 
        </p>
        <br>______<br><br><br>
        <div id="f2021e6">entry # 6</div>
        <p>
            So today is the day of the physics exam. I look at the exam, and the only thing I know is my name. I want to cry and give up. Thank God they gave us 
            formula sheets. Otherwise, I don’t even know anymore.<br><br>Okay, so I think I know how to answer this question. I remember how to do it - vaguely. 
            I write down the equations and put in the numbers. I use my calculator and oh my god I hate scientific calculators so much. Why the fuck can’t we use
            graphing calculators? Like I keep on erasing my answer, and forgetting it. And we can’t store answers as variables.<br><br>Grr. And I don’t know what
            I’m doing. <br><br> My answer is 4509 N. And the answer choices are 43N, 25N, 16N, 30N. Well 4509 is closest to 43 right? Let’s bubble that.<br><br>
            And I don’t know how to answer any of the questions. <br><br> Ok, ok. I’m okay. I’m okay. I’m not going to die. No, I am going to die. I’m 19 and I’m 
            going to die.<br><br>You know what, you know what? I’m done. I’m so fucking done.<br><br>Fuck this shit. I put answer choices on my eraser, and roll it.
            <br><br>Okay, for number 1, it’s choice A. <br><br> For number 2, it’s choice C.<br><br>For number 3, it’s choice B. And I go on. <br><br>Okay I’m on the
            last question, question 10. Maybe I should try to answer this question. I look at it, and I am so lost. Screw it, I’m putting C. I never want to do 
            this again.<br><br>I pick up my papers and hand it to the lady in the front and all but run out of the room, relieved it’s over.

            Technically, I should not skip class. But, in my defense, I just was not in the mood to go to class. It was math class, specifically Data Analysis. 
            At the moment, we were learning about probability. I hate probability with a passion, more than I hate myself, which is saying something.<br><br>
            Don’t look at me like that. Besides, I know better from last year. I will for sure try to learn everything on my own. I cannot afford to be on 
            academic probation this year. My GPA cannot handle it. It’s already threatening to fall. <br><br>But yes, going to class is a lost cause because 
            the train was delayed and came late. So really, it’s not my fault. This is just a sign for me to not go to class. This is God’s way of telling me 
            I shouldn’t go to class. I’m just listening. <br><br>So that’s why I’m here on my phone, doing more important stuff, like watching Tiktok. 
            There’s just something about Tiktok, appealing and yet wasting my time. But it really is my fault for wasting my time when I should be studying 
            or something. <br><br> Whatever. That's future me’s problem. <br><br>Ok, ok, it’s ten minutes later. And I should actually do some work. I turn on
            my laptop and go to my emails, like a responsible adult would do.<br><br>But then, I get sucked into the world of fanfiction, specifically Harry 
            Potter fanfiction. But to be honest, can you really blame me? Like it’s Harry Potter? It’s Ao3, we’re talking about?! They have some of the best 
            fanfictions out there. And like it is a work I’m subscribed to, so it does deserve my attention unlike school work. <br><br>At least fanfictions 
            make me happy, and isn’t that what’s really important - to do what makes you happy. <br><br>It’s fifteen minutes later, and I’m mourning the fact 
            that there’s no more chapters left. I ended up rereading the entire  fanfiction two more times, though there weren't a lot of chapters, in all 
            honesty.

            Holy shit. So like remember how I barely go to math class because I just hate probability. And I just cannot understand it for my life. 
            <br><br>By the way, I did study in the end. When I got home, I would end up studying it and learning it. I even watched Youtube videos,
            and read the the fucking textbook. But like guess what, guess what! Okay, so I’m in class, of course I’m not paying attention. 
            If you haven’t learnt by now, I barely pay attention in class. But I’m opening up brightspace, and I’m checking the little bell because 
            it has the red dot so I have to check it or it will annoy me forever. <br><br>Holy shit. Holy shit. So like you know how I just don’t go 
            to data analysis because like I said, I just hate probability with my entire soul. Right, well, I got an 81 on the exam, a B-. <br><br>Holy 
            shit. This is amazing. I’m actually proud of myself. I did not think that was going to happen. Because I expected to get a C or a D. <br><br>
            Wait a minute, let me check Gradescope to see if they uploaded the exam. I always forget my username and password, so like I have to guess 
            my password. And sometimes it’s a hit or miss. Otherwise, I just reset my password.<br><br>Okay, I’m logged in. Nice. Let me check it. 
            Woah, I actually got full points for questions I had no idea what to do. I say this because I remember for one of the questions I had no idea
            how to do it. Okay, so like my philosophy is that if I don’t know how to solve a question, I skip it and pray for the best. This was the first
            question too, so even better. But I remember that I got some inspiration, so I did something. And look at that, I got full scores on the question. 
            <br><br>Look at me, not going to class and still acing.<br><br>That’s magic.

            Okay, so today is my cs midterm - data structures. If you don't know this, I'm well retaking this class. Why, you ask? What a great question.
            The answer is that I'm a fucking idiot. I was off the rails last semester. But that's not the point of today's entry. But I did not fail the 
            class last semester. I did pass - barely - but I passed. But I did not meet the requirement to go to the next class. Because I'm a fucking
            disappointment, which we all know. <br><br> Anyways! I'm going to go take the exam, and this time I have been taking notes and studying
            and going over the practice exams. Okay, I'm heading inside the room now. Will type up later. <br><br> Okay! I'm done. I handed my papers in
            and here I am. Okay, so compared to last semester, I was not as hopeless, I feel like. I can confidently say for sure that I will not get a 
            12%. But if I do, let's just say you will never hear from me again. <br><br> --- <br><br> For legal reasons, that was a joke. <br><br>
            Okay, I'm going to go do hot student shit.
